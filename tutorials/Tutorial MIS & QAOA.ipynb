    "For example, assume an ensemble of identical radio transmitters over French cities that each have the same radius of transmission. It was quickly realized that two transmitters with close or equal frequencies could interfere with one another, hence the necessity to assign non-interfering frequencies to overlapping transmiting towers. Because of the limited amount of bandwith space, some towers have to be assigned the same or close frequencies. The MIS of a graph of towers indicate the maximum number of towers that can have close or equal given frequency (red points). \n",

We map a  ground state and a Rydberg state of each atom to a spin $1/2$, where $|0 \\rangle = |r \\rangle$ is a Rydberg state and $|1 \\rangle = |g \\rangle$ is a ground state. An atom in a Rydberg state has an excited electron with a very high principal quantum number and therefore exhibits a huge electric dipole moment. As such, when two atoms are excited to Rydberg states, they exhibit a strong van der Waals interaction. Placing $N$ atoms at positions $\\textbf{r}_j$ in a 2D plane, and coupling the ground state $|1\\rangle$ to the Rydberg state $|0\\rangle$ with a laser system enables the realization of the Hamiltonian :\n",
